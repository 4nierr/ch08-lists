# Exercise-2

In this exercise, you'll practice 

* `lappy()` function to manipulate lists
* `strsplit` to extract letters from character vectors

As in previous exercises, you should fork and clone this repository,
follow the instructions in the `exercise.R` file, then `add` and
`commit` your changes so that you can `push` them back up to GitHub.
